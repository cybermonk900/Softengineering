#First exercise:
# code in order to evaluate the results of four basic arithmetic operations.

# input a float value for variable a here
a=float(input("enter a value for number a: "))
# input a float value for variable b here
b=float(input("enter a value for number b: "))
# output the result of addition here
sum_of_a_and_b=a+b
print("sum of a and b is:", sum_of_a_and_b)
# output the result of subtraction here
subtraction_of_a_and_b=a - b
print("subtraction of a and b is:", subtraction_of_a_and_b)
# output the result of multiplication here
multiplication_of_a_and_b=a*b
print("multiplication of a and b is:", multiplication_of_a_and_b)
# output the result of division here
division_of_a_and_b=a/b
print("division of a and b is:", division_of_a_and_b)
# output the result of exponent here
exponent_of_a=a**2
exponent_of_b=b**2
print("exponent of a is:", exponent_of_a, "and exponent of b is:", exponent_of_b)
# output the result of floor division here
floor_division_of_a_and_b=a//b
print("floor division of a and b is:", floor_division_of_a_and_b)
print("\nThat's all, folks!")

#Second exercise
  # to evaluate an expression

x = float(input("Enter value for x: "))
y=1/(x+1/(x+1/(x+1/x)))

print("y =", y)

  #Third exercise
  #a simple code able to evaluate the end time of a period of time, given as a number of minutes (it could be arbitrarily large). The start time is given as a pair of hours (0..23) and minutes (0..59). The result has to be printed to the console

hour = int(input("Starting time (hours): "))
mins = int(input("Starting time (minutes): "))
dura = int(input("Event duration (minutes): "))

minutes=(mins+dura) % 60 # using modulus to get remaining minutes
hours = int(hour + (mins +dura) / 60) %24 # using modulus to add hours if duration is more than 60 minutes

print(hours,":",minutes)
